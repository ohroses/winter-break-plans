# winter-break-plans
I am lucky enough to have a couple weeks off for Winter Break. I'm compiling a list of all the things I want to accomplish during the time off!

## Focus Points
As I will not be at home, I am focusing on learning objectives that I can conduct in the cloud/on my laptop and games I can play on my mobile devices. Next year I want to orient my work towards web engineering so I am focusing on points that I am weak on that I could use a crash-course in: Javacsript frameworks, build/deploy pipelines, and AWS. There is also good hiking/exercise opportunties where I will be going in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area and want to take advantage of that.
